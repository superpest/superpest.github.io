The Colors of the Traffic Light
Traffic lights are very important. They help drivers know when to stop and go. Traffic lights change to three colors: green, yellow, and red. Drivers must know what each color means.

Green means go. When the traffic light is green, drivers can go. When one side of traffic has a green light, the other side has a red light. The other cars must wait until it is their turn to go.

Yellow means slow down. When the traffic light turns yellow, a driver needs to slow down and get ready to stop. A yellow light signals to the driver that a red light is coming soon.

Red means stop. When the traffic light is red, cars must stop. The cars have to wait until it is their turn to go. It is important for drivers to stop at the right time.

Traffic lights keep drivers safe on the road. If everyone follows the rules of the road, people can get places quickly and safely.
